# sin and cos project
this is a small project to find out the values of sines and cosines approximately it is based on recursion and the formula below
![lim x-> 0 sinx/x = 1](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTw2_Tw3nhFdU0zWriNHhNLHTY-a2hscDqKSiRjFa9orRrzIfONYvp-VBb8gbk5FkQunhE&usqp=CAU)
that indicates when x is pretty small in practice from less than 10 degrees tha value of sin is the same as x in radian and the same way sin(Ï€/2 - x ) / x = 1 when x is less than 10 degrees
